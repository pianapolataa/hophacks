# MedTwin
We built MedTwin to simplify the process of finding the right medication dosage by creating a digital twin of each patient, which gives patients a safe way to experiment and predict responses to different medication dosages before trying them in real life. We trained a Seq2Seq LSTM model that can be easily trained on clinical trial data for more accurate results.
